# Overview

**Collect the Cherries** is simple aracde 2D platformer in which the player has fifteen to twenty seconds to collect all of the cherries in the stage. There are three stages, each with a different difficulty level. (Easy, medium, and hard). 

To play the game run *collect_the_cherries.exe* on Windows, or unzip *collect_the_cherriesMACOS* and compile the project in Godot on Mac. (I only have Windows, sorry Mac users)

One of the ways I express my appreciation for something is by imagining or making my own version, and since I like video games, I decided to learn Godot to create my own. To learn godot I completed the [GdQuest Learn Code from Zero - Gd Script Tutorials](https://gdquest.github.io/learn-gdscript/) and followed along the [Godot Game Development – Crash Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg) video tutorial before making collect the cherries to demonstrate what I learned.

# Development Environment

To develop my game I used the Godot game engine and VScode

The programming language I used was Godot's GdScript, and any libraries I used were included in Godot by default.
The [Sunny Land Asset Pack](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art) was used for the graphics.
